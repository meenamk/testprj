<p>Smart grids offer better energy management for
consumers as well as energy companies using bi-directional
communication and control. With the advent of smart homes,
energy companies can balance energy supply and demand to
a large extent using many sensors/meters deployed. They can
also nudge consumers to shift their demands to off-peak hours
for load balancing and monetary benefits. We propose a decentralized
demand scheduling algorithm that minimizes consumer
discomfort and electricity cost of a household. Our algorithm
utilizes only aggregated energy consumption of a household to
derive optimal appliance level demand schedules. Furthermore,
a low-complexity energy disaggregation algorithm is proposed
to derive fine-grained appliance information and consumer preferences.
We propose three important coefficients related to the
energy usage of consumers. We utilize them to derive optimal
day-ahead demand schedules. The decentralized algorithm is
empirically evaluated using real-world energy usage data from
open datasets, which include our own deployment. Our proposed
scheduling algorithm saves up to 30% energy cost. This paper is
one of the first to derive day-ahead schedules using real-world
data from multiple households.</p>
