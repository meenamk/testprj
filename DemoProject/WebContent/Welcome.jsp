<p>Smart grids offer better energy management for consumers as well
		as energy companies using bi-directional communication and control.
		With the advent of smart homes, energy companies can balance energy
		supply and demand to a large extent using many sensors/meters
		deployed. They can also nudge consumers to shift their demands to
		off-peak hours for load balancing and monetary benefits. We propose a
		decentralized demand scheduling algorithm that minimizes consumer
		discomfort and electricity cost of a household. Our algorithm utilizes
		only aggregated energy consumption of a household to derive optimal
		appliance level demand schedules. Furthermore, a low-complexity energy
		disaggregation algorithm is proposed to derive fine-grained appliance
		information and consumer preferences. We propose three important
		coefficients related to the energy usage of consumers. We utilize them
		to derive optimal day-ahead demand schedules. The decentralized
		algorithm is empirically evaluated using real-world energy usage data
		from open datasets, which include our own deployment. Our proposed
		scheduling algorithm saves up to 30% energy cost. This paper is one of
		the first to derive day-ahead schedules using real-world data from
		multiple households.</p>
